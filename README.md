# Websites
These are a collection of websites I have created using only HTML and CSS

- Creative Studio tests my ability to implement a sticky header, horizontal scrolling content, a parallax
scroll background, and semantic forms.
- Cultivate tests my ability to adapt to using libraries as it was created only using the Bootstrap library
- Good Food tests my ability to create a responsive navigation
- XYZ Power was my first project and tests my ability to create a responsive web page
